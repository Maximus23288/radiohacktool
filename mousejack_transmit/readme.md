Map the star network that address 61:49:66:82:03 belongs to

```
./nrf24-network-mapper.py -a 61:49:66:82:03
```

## continuous tone test

The nRF24LU1+ chips include a test mechanism to transmit a continuous tone, the frequency of which can be verified if you have access to an SDR. There is the potential for frequency offsets between devices to cause unexpected behavior. For instance, one of the SparkFun breakout boards that was tested had a frequency offset of ~300kHz, which caused it to receive packets on two adjacent channels.

This script will cause the transceiver to transmit a tone on the first channel that is passed in. 

```
usage: ./nrf24-continuous-tone-test.py [-h] [-c N [N ...]] [-v] [-l]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                          show this help message and exit
  -c N [N ...], --channels N [N ...]  RF channels
  -v, --verbose                       Enable verbose output
  -l, --lna                           Enable the LNA (for CrazyRadio PA dongles)

```

Transmit a continuous tone at 2405MHz

```
./nrf24-continuous-tone-test.py -c 5
```

## Packet generator script

This uses a dictionary to map keyboard presses to the equivalent packets. It reads stdin input and logs the mapped packets to logs/keystrokes.log.
It will accept input until Ctrl+C is pressed.

```
usage: ./keymapper.py 
```

# Log files

The folder **logs** contains various pre-saved packets for various keyboard operations.  
The file **keys.log** serves as a reference where various key presses and combinations are mapped to their equivalent packets.
